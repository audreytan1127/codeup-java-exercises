//used.

//        COMMAND LINE CALCULATOR
//        The program should welcome the user, prompt them for a calculation, and give the result. The
//        user should be prompted after each result is outputted if they want to enter another calculation.
//        When they say no, give them an exit message. Allow the user first to specify how many
//        operands they will enter. Do not worry about input validation (assume user enters correct data
//        type)
